    content: "None of us are strangers to Donald Trump’s online presence. Before it was Truth Social it was Twitter (about 57,000 times), but now its AI generated images, ChatGPT, and pretty much all the generative content the English department at UChicago has devoted themselves to destroying. And that feels normal to see on social media right? I mean, we all see AI generated images on our for you pages, and at this point it might be hard to define internet culture and trends without it.\n\nHowever, what differentiates (or at least feels like it should differentiate) me seeing “tralaleo tralala” on TikTok from me seeing Donald Trump’s AI images is a hypothetical hierarchy of reliable information. At the risk of stating the obvious, Donald Trump is our president, and I am not (yes, my parents are really paying 100k for a polisci degree for that – money well spent). My TikTok algorithm and Trump’s social feeds ideally should be held to different standards of accuracy and authenticity, but the way Trump has used AI is not for meaningless memes – instead, it’s for targeted political advertising.\n\nIn a twisted way, it’s brilliant.\n\nTo give some context, political ads have a weird history—I mean, really weird. From the “Pretty Girls for Nixon” campaign, underscoring Nixon’s placement of women in political (and previously male-dominated) positions, to “Vote Al Smith and Make Your Wet Dreams Come True” championing an anti-prohibition candidate from NYC in the 1928 presidential election, political advertisements are known to, on occasion, tow the line. Strange and peusdo-sexual slogans aside, what Trump is doing here is both novel and exactly the same as these older ads.\n\nAI humor is being marketed to younger Gen Z audiences, and by using the same templates, Trump is isolating a certain demographic (again, not unheard of), but he’s playing on a virtual presence we haven’t seen before. Gen Z humor is…at the risk of insulting my own generation…weird? I mean, in our defense, we were the first iPad kids, but this is the group that has meshed Shrek and Mike Wazowski and occasionally laughs at 9/11 jokes. Dark, ironic humor finds its niche in this younger audience and it’s fine because we’ve bred an internet culture that normalizes the kind of shit you can’t really say in person. (For more on this, see previous Donk! article)\n\nHowever, here’s what’s different from the era of political ads of the past: the kind of ridiculous, slightly alarming content no campaign or administration would sink actual money or resources into has now been made accessible by AI. This has allowed Trump to really focus in on a few specific qualities in his marketing, and to produce as much of this ridiculous content as he wants.\n\nFirstly, controversy (not that Trump has shied away from controversy in the past)! Specifically, this applies to AI-generated content like Trump Gaza, which capitalizes on every real estate tycoon’s fantasy of turning an active warzone into some kind of Four-Seasons-hotel-meets-water- park resort.\n\nTrump has also focused on images of strength that are so outlandish, I’d almost categorize them as satire. Envision the president holding a (red) lightsaber doing his best Anakin Skywalker + Gym Bro impression. If you put orange face paint on Palpatine, I guess I kind of see the resemblance.\n\nAnd finally, content I can really only describe as defamatory. This includes such internet gems as House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries in overtly racist Mexican clothing.\n\nNow, to add my own opinion to the plethora of NYT articles about Trumpian AI: this technology has made him bolder. Not only is AI marketing quick and easy, but in the era of meme culture, especially as this is circulated to Gen Z (the generation of dark humor and brainrot), it is allowed to be insulting and occasionally outwardly offensive. Congrats Internet! You’ve successfully desensitized us. Our president can post AI generated videos of Taylor Swift endorsing him, or his political opponents as USSR communists (“Comrade Kamala” for those of you who have followed this cursed journey across the past two years) and we barely bat an eye. AI is now established in political marketing, and it has settled in well in this new era of mudslinging political rhetoric – like when Trump posted a generated video of him literally dumping shit onto protestors from a jet.\n\nDespite established AI risks (intellectual property concerns, environmental factors, malicious international influence) now generative technology is being used to fuel the political marketing machine. A new frontier of public politics has arrived: certain demographics are still being targeted, but their humor and scrolling help to mass produce content, much of which goes without any kind of fact (or reality) checking.\n\nSo, to address such a serious and abrupt shift in the political landscape, one that encapsulates a massive uptick in misleading, racist, xenophobic content, we can only expect a momentous and proportional response from the Democratic party, right?!?\n\nOf course not! With such scathing replies as “deeply unserious and deeply unpresidential” from Hakeem Jeffries and literally no condemning quote to be found from any other party leader, can we instead turn to democratic legislation as a response to this pressing issue?\n\nDon’t count on it. On the state level, former Governor Glenn Youngkin vetoed a bill in the General Assembly of Virginia earlier this year that would have required the disclosure of AI-generated content in campaign materials. The REAL Political Advertisements Act and the AI Transparency in Election Act have been introduced by Senator Klobuchar, both of which would mandate disclaimers for political ads, but neither piece of legislation has passed.\n\nSo for now, we’re sticking with the well-established Democratic strategy of thoughts and prayers regarding this issue. No matter how much we’d all like to ignore it, though, the new frontier of AI is political advertisements and Donald Trump is leading that charge.",

    content: "A little over a year ago we witnessed a national bloodbath: Kamala Harris vs the swing states. Any devoted Democrat can tell you about the trauma of Tuesday November 5, 2024, in which CNN’s Wolf Blitzer slowly called North Carolina for Donald Trump…and then Arizona…and then Nevada… by the next morning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia and Michigan were all bright red.\n\nWhile Trump never surpassed 53% of the vote in any of these critical swings (the closest he came was winning 52.5% of the vote in Arizona), a full sweep of the swing states was, to put this delicately, horribly devastating to the Democratic ticket, and surprised even the major news outlets.\n\nFast forward a year, however, and Democrats are on the up-and-up.\n\nMost headlines have been about the obvious—a Democratic Socialist winning the New York mayoral election, the former roommate power couple of DC’s victories in New Jersey and Virginian gubernatorial elections respectively, and a deep blue redistricting of California—but Democrats had other wins this year. I’m specifically talking about smaller, but still significant steps in Pennsylvania and Georgia.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Democrat Larry Krasner maintained his district attorney position in Philadelphia by a whopping 75.42% of the vote, Pennsylvania voted YES on three Democrats (Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty, and David Wecht) retaining their seats on the state Supreme Court, and voter turnout hit record highs. Democrat Joe Kahn was elected Bucks County district attorney with over 54% of the vote, in a position that has not gone to a Democrat since the 1800s, in a county that helped carry Trump to victory 12 months ago.\n\nIn Georgia, Democrats Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson flipped two seats on Georgia’s Public Service Commission by 63% of the vote. This is the first time a Democrat has won statewide office in Georgia since 2006!\n\nI’m not going to sit here and pretend that this change mirrors some massive ideological shift in these states, as evidenced by only 30% of the turnout from last year’s presidential election showing up for local elections in Georgia, but clearly something is different from last year. So, what is it? What can we take away?\n\n1. It’s the economy, stupid. Democrats are winning on the economy, a notoriously Republican dominated issue. I think this is especially pertinent in Georgia, where running on affordability measures related to electricity bills, while still pressing the issue of environmentally sustainable practices was the ticket to success. If we take this issue out of the swing states, a large part of Zohran Mamdani’s campaign in NYC also centered on affordability measures (but I’m not going to harp on this too much because I’m personally against all the articles currently in circulation that insist on treating the big apple as a microcosm of the rest of the country). Between a government shutdown and tariffs putting pressure on consumers, the field is wide open for Democrats to recover some of their working class, pro-affordability platform that obviously works.\n\n2. Ok, onto voting itself. There were massive discrepancies in the amount of voters in these two states: historic turnout in Pennsylvania, but 70% of last year’s voters didn’t show in Georgia. However, Democrats won in both places. What we can extrapolate from this is that there is a blue base that is turning out more consistently than their red counterparts. The Democratic messaging on voting is working, and has created a coalition that is mobilized, even for races that seem inconsequential (ie, utility board).\n\n3. Identity politics are back? Ok, maybe not in that way, but Democrats have the opportunity to make serious headway with minority groups that have left their base in recent election cycles. How do I know that? They just did.\n\nLatinos have been a sore spot for Democrats in the last few years, with Trump seeing a 14% increase in his Latino support from 2020 to 2024. The impact of the Latino vote leaning red was even more pronounced in swing states like Arizona, Nevada and Georgia, all of which experienced an increase in the number of eligible Latino voters in 2024. But Democrats just might be winning those votes back. While data on Pennsylvania itself has yet to be published, the democratic candidates in gubernatorial elections of New Jersey and Virginia both had 30% margins with Latino voters. The reason I think the data on Pennsylvania might be even more illuminating is because Pennsylvania has a large (1.1 million) Latino population, which has been growing over the last 20 years. Democrats winning back those votes, might just be the key to flipping the state in the next presidential election, and will be interesting to watch in the midterms (for all you poll nerds, PA’s 2026 midterm races include the House, Governor, and seats in both the State Senate and House).\n\n4. Finally, party identity. What we learned is that one-size-fits-all, may not apply to liberalism, and that’s okay. For a year now, we’ve all heard the questions: do Democrats need to shift farther left? Is a more centrist approach the way to win back votes? Could a woman head the ticket after the last two female nominees lost on the national stage? Election night 2025 may have proved we were asking the wrong things entirely.\n\nAlright, let me back up. Moderate candidates with strong military and law backgrounds won in Virginia and New Jersey. A highly progressive democratic socialist whose greatest qualification was State Assemblyman took the victory in New York City. A blend of political experience and fresh faces, a mix of extremely liberal and also left-leaning centrist policies were the key to victory across the board. In Pennsylvania it was moderate Democrats that came out on top in almost all races. While these individual candidates all have their strengths, they speak to a bigger message Democrats need to hear: it’s time for the party to embrace its differences. A one-size-fits-all candidate is not going to do as well in all states.\n\nDemocratic leadership needs to acknowledge different platforms are going to be successful in different parts of the country, and the primary process needs to play out. At a time like this, where we are struggling collectively to gain a party identity, closed door meetings are not going to cut it - allowing voters to dictate the future of the party and tell you what resonantes with them will. With this in mind, maybe we should instead be asking how we can field the strongest primary contenders (yes, contenders plural) ahead of 2028.\n\nSo to summarize: this is a win, and it should be treated as such. Seeing blue progress universally, but especially throughout swing states in the midst of such a harmful red agenda is a win. What we can’t do though, is treat this as if the hard work is done. ‘We got the votes out in an off-election year, people are so pissed with Trump, they’ll vote blue up and down the ballot no matter what’ is not a winning attitude. My challenge to Democrats is to remember 2024. Remember the terrifying free fall we all felt after each swing state was called for Trump. Remember questioning what went wrong and what we can do to fix it. The hard work isn’t over, and we now have our marching orders. Let’s go win.",
