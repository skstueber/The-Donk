    content: "None of us are strangers to Donald Trump’s online presence. Before it was Truth Social it was Twitter (about 57,000 times), but now its AI generated images, ChatGPT, and pretty much all the generative content the English department at UChicago has devoted themselves to destroying. And that feels normal to see on social media right? I mean, we all see AI generated images on our for you pages, and at this point it might be hard to define internet culture and trends without it. However, what differentiates (or at least feels like it should differentiate) me seeing “tralaleo tralala” on TikTok from me seeing Donald Trump’s AI images is a hypothetical hierarchy of reliable information. At the risk of stating the obvious, Donald Trump is our president, and I am not (yes, my parents are really paying 100k for a polisci degree for that – money well spent). My TikTok algorithm and Trump’s social feeds ideally should be held to different standards of accuracy and authenticity, but the way Trump has used AI is not for meaningless memes – instead, it’s for targeted political advertising. In a twisted way, it’s brilliant.To give some context, political ads have a weird history—I mean, really weird. From the “Pretty Girls for Nixon” campaign, underscoring Nixon’s placement of women in political (and previously male-dominated) positions, to “Vote Al Smith and Make Your Wet Dreams Come True” championing an anti-prohibition candidate from NYC in the 1928 presidential election, political advertisements are known to, on occasion, tow the line. Strange and peusdo-sexual slogans aside, what Trump is doing here is both novel and exactly the same as these older ads. AI humor is being marketed to younger Gen Z audiences, and by using the same templates, Trump is isolating a certain demographic (again, not unheard of), but he’s playing on a virtual presence we haven’t seen before. Gen Z humor is…at the risk of insulting my own generation…weird? I mean, in our defense, we were the first iPad kids, but this is the group that has meshed Shrek and Mike Wazowski and occasionally laughs at 9/11 jokes. Dark, ironic humor finds its niche in this younger audience and it’s fine because we’ve bred an internet culture that normalizes the kind of shit you can’t really say in person. (For more on this, see previous Donk! article) However, here’s what’s different from the era of political ads of the past: the kind of ridiculous, slightly alarming content no campaign or administration would sink actual money or resources into has now been made accessible by AI. This has allowed Trump to really focus in on a few specific qualities in his marketing, and to produce as much of this ridiculous content as he wants. Firstly, controversy (not that Trump has shied away from controversy in the past)! Specifically, this applies to AI-generated content like Trump Gaza, which capitalizes on every real estate tycoon’s fantasy of turning an active warzone into some kind of Four-Seasons-hotel-meets-water- park resort. Trump has also focused on images of strength that are so outlandish, I’d almost categorize them as satire. Envision the president holding a (red) lightsaber doing his best Anakin Skywalker + Gym Bro impression. If you put orange face paint on Palpatine, I guess I kind of see the resemblance. And finally, content I can really only describe as defamatory. This includes such internet gems as House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries in overtly racist Mexican clothing. Now, to add my own opinion to the plethora of NYT articles about Trumpian AI: this technology has made him bolder. Not only is AI marketing quick and easy, but in the era of meme culture, especially as this is circulated to Gen Z (the generation of dark humor and brainrot), it is allowed to be insulting and occasionally outwardly offensive. Congrats Internet! You’ve successfully desensitized us. Our president can post AI generated videos of Taylor Swift endorsing him, or his political opponents as USSR communists (“Comrade Kamala” for those of you who have followed this cursed journey across the past two years) and we barely bat an eye. AI is now established in political marketing, and it has settled in well in this new era of mudslinging political rhetoric – like when Trump posted a generated video of him literally dumping shit onto protestors from a jet. Despite established AI risks (intellectual property concerns, environmental factors, malicious international influence) now generative technology is being used to fuel the political marketing machine. A new frontier of public politics has arrived: certain demographics are still being targeted, but their humor and scrolling help to mass produce content, much of which goes without any kind of fact (or reality) checking. So, to address such a serious and abrupt shift in the political landscape, one that encapsulates a massive uptick in misleading, racist, xenophobic content, we can only expect a momentous and proportional response from the Democratic party, right?!? Of course not! With such scathing replies as “deeply unserious and deeply unpresidential” from Hakeem Jeffries and literally no condemning quote to be found from any other party leader, can we instead turn to democratic legislation as a response to this pressing issue? Don’t count on it. On the state level, former Governor Glenn Youngkin vetoed a bill in the General Assembly of Virginia earlier this year that would have required the disclosure of AI-generated content in campaign materials. The REAL Political Advertisements Act and the AI Transparency in Election Act have been introduced by Senator Klobuchar, both of which would mandate disclaimers for political ads, but neither piece of legislation has passed. So for now, we’re sticking with the well-established Democratic strategy of thoughts and prayers regarding this issue. No matter how much we’d all like to ignore it, though, the new frontier of AI is political advertisements and Donald Trump is leading that charge.",
