    content: "None of us are strangers to Donald Trump’s online presence. Before it was Truth Social it was Twitter (about 57,000 times), but now its AI generated images, ChatGPT, and pretty much all the generative content the English department at UChicago has devoted themselves to destroying. And that feels normal to see on social media right? I mean, we all see AI generated images on our for you pages, and at this point it might be hard to define internet culture and trends without it.\n\nHowever, what differentiates (or at least feels like it should differentiate) me seeing “tralaleo tralala” on TikTok from me seeing Donald Trump’s AI images is a hypothetical hierarchy of reliable information. At the risk of stating the obvious, Donald Trump is our president, and I am not (yes, my parents are really paying 100k for a polisci degree for that – money well spent). My TikTok algorithm and Trump’s social feeds ideally should be held to different standards of accuracy and authenticity, but the way Trump has used AI is not for meaningless memes – instead, it’s for targeted political advertising.\n\nIn a twisted way, it’s brilliant.\n\nTo give some context, political ads have a weird history—I mean, really weird. From the “Pretty Girls for Nixon” campaign, underscoring Nixon’s placement of women in political (and previously male-dominated) positions, to “Vote Al Smith and Make Your Wet Dreams Come True” championing an anti-prohibition candidate from NYC in the 1928 presidential election, political advertisements are known to, on occasion, tow the line. Strange and peusdo-sexual slogans aside, what Trump is doing here is both novel and exactly the same as these older ads.\n\nAI humor is being marketed to younger Gen Z audiences, and by using the same templates, Trump is isolating a certain demographic (again, not unheard of), but he’s playing on a virtual presence we haven’t seen before. Gen Z humor is…at the risk of insulting my own generation…weird? I mean, in our defense, we were the first iPad kids, but this is the group that has meshed Shrek and Mike Wazowski and occasionally laughs at 9/11 jokes. Dark, ironic humor finds its niche in this younger audience and it’s fine because we’ve bred an internet culture that normalizes the kind of shit you can’t really say in person. (For more on this, see previous Donk! article)\n\nHowever, here’s what’s different from the era of political ads of the past: the kind of ridiculous, slightly alarming content no campaign or administration would sink actual money or resources into has now been made accessible by AI. This has allowed Trump to really focus in on a few specific qualities in his marketing, and to produce as much of this ridiculous content as he wants.\n\nFirstly, controversy (not that Trump has shied away from controversy in the past)! Specifically, this applies to AI-generated content like Trump Gaza, which capitalizes on every real estate tycoon’s fantasy of turning an active warzone into some kind of Four-Seasons-hotel-meets-water- park resort.\n\nTrump has also focused on images of strength that are so outlandish, I’d almost categorize them as satire. Envision the president holding a (red) lightsaber doing his best Anakin Skywalker + Gym Bro impression. If you put orange face paint on Palpatine, I guess I kind of see the resemblance.\n\nAnd finally, content I can really only describe as defamatory. This includes such internet gems as House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries in overtly racist Mexican clothing.\n\nNow, to add my own opinion to the plethora of NYT articles about Trumpian AI: this technology has made him bolder. Not only is AI marketing quick and easy, but in the era of meme culture, especially as this is circulated to Gen Z (the generation of dark humor and brainrot), it is allowed to be insulting and occasionally outwardly offensive. Congrats Internet! You’ve successfully desensitized us. Our president can post AI generated videos of Taylor Swift endorsing him, or his political opponents as USSR communists (“Comrade Kamala” for those of you who have followed this cursed journey across the past two years) and we barely bat an eye. AI is now established in political marketing, and it has settled in well in this new era of mudslinging political rhetoric – like when Trump posted a generated video of him literally dumping shit onto protestors from a jet.\n\nDespite established AI risks (intellectual property concerns, environmental factors, malicious international influence) now generative technology is being used to fuel the political marketing machine. A new frontier of public politics has arrived: certain demographics are still being targeted, but their humor and scrolling help to mass produce content, much of which goes without any kind of fact (or reality) checking.\n\nSo, to address such a serious and abrupt shift in the political landscape, one that encapsulates a massive uptick in misleading, racist, xenophobic content, we can only expect a momentous and proportional response from the Democratic party, right?!?\n\nOf course not! With such scathing replies as “deeply unserious and deeply unpresidential” from Hakeem Jeffries and literally no condemning quote to be found from any other party leader, can we instead turn to democratic legislation as a response to this pressing issue?\n\nDon’t count on it. On the state level, former Governor Glenn Youngkin vetoed a bill in the General Assembly of Virginia earlier this year that would have required the disclosure of AI-generated content in campaign materials. The REAL Political Advertisements Act and the AI Transparency in Election Act have been introduced by Senator Klobuchar, both of which would mandate disclaimers for political ads, but neither piece of legislation has passed.\n\nSo for now, we’re sticking with the well-established Democratic strategy of thoughts and prayers regarding this issue. No matter how much we’d all like to ignore it, though, the new frontier of AI is political advertisements and Donald Trump is leading that charge.",

    content: "A little over a year ago we witnessed a national bloodbath: Kamala Harris vs the swing states. Any devoted Democrat can tell you about the trauma of Tuesday November 5, 2024, in which CNN’s Wolf Blitzer slowly called North Carolina for Donald Trump…and then Arizona…and then Nevada… by the next morning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia and Michigan were all bright red.\n\nWhile Trump never surpassed 53% of the vote in any of these critical swings (the closest he came was winning 52.5% of the vote in Arizona), a full sweep of the swing states was, to put this delicately, horribly devastating to the Democratic ticket, and surprised even the major news outlets.\n\nFast forward a year, however, and Democrats are on the up-and-up.\n\nMost headlines have been about the obvious—a Democratic Socialist winning the New York mayoral election, the former roommate power couple of DC’s victories in New Jersey and Virginian gubernatorial elections respectively, and a deep blue redistricting of California—but Democrats had other wins this year. I’m specifically talking about smaller, but still significant steps in Pennsylvania and Georgia.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Democrat Larry Krasner maintained his district attorney position in Philadelphia by a whopping 75.42% of the vote, Pennsylvania voted YES on three Democrats (Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty, and David Wecht) retaining their seats on the state Supreme Court, and voter turnout hit record highs. Democrat Joe Kahn was elected Bucks County district attorney with over 54% of the vote, in a position that has not gone to a Democrat since the 1800s, in a county that helped carry Trump to victory 12 months ago.\n\nIn Georgia, Democrats Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson flipped two seats on Georgia’s Public Service Commission by 63% of the vote. This is the first time a Democrat has won statewide office in Georgia since 2006!\n\nI’m not going to sit here and pretend that this change mirrors some massive ideological shift in these states, as evidenced by only 30% of the turnout from last year’s presidential election showing up for local elections in Georgia, but clearly something is different from last year. So, what is it? What can we take away?\n\n1. It’s the economy, stupid. Democrats are winning on the economy, a notoriously Republican dominated issue. I think this is especially pertinent in Georgia, where running on affordability measures related to electricity bills, while still pressing the issue of environmentally sustainable practices was the ticket to success. If we take this issue out of the swing states, a large part of Zohran Mamdani’s campaign in NYC also centered on affordability measures (but I’m not going to harp on this too much because I’m personally against all the articles currently in circulation that insist on treating the big apple as a microcosm of the rest of the country). Between a government shutdown and tariffs putting pressure on consumers, the field is wide open for Democrats to recover some of their working class, pro-affordability platform that obviously works.\n\n2. Ok, onto voting itself. There were massive discrepancies in the amount of voters in these two states: historic turnout in Pennsylvania, but 70% of last year’s voters didn’t show in Georgia. However, Democrats won in both places. What we can extrapolate from this is that there is a blue base that is turning out more consistently than their red counterparts. The Democratic messaging on voting is working, and has created a coalition that is mobilized, even for races that seem inconsequential (ie, utility board).\n\n3. Identity politics are back? Ok, maybe not in that way, but Democrats have the opportunity to make serious headway with minority groups that have left their base in recent election cycles. How do I know that? They just did.\n\nLatinos have been a sore spot for Democrats in the last few years, with Trump seeing a 14% increase in his Latino support from 2020 to 2024. The impact of the Latino vote leaning red was even more pronounced in swing states like Arizona, Nevada and Georgia, all of which experienced an increase in the number of eligible Latino voters in 2024. But Democrats just might be winning those votes back. While data on Pennsylvania itself has yet to be published, the democratic candidates in gubernatorial elections of New Jersey and Virginia both had 30% margins with Latino voters. The reason I think the data on Pennsylvania might be even more illuminating is because Pennsylvania has a large (1.1 million) Latino population, which has been growing over the last 20 years. Democrats winning back those votes, might just be the key to flipping the state in the next presidential election, and will be interesting to watch in the midterms (for all you poll nerds, PA’s 2026 midterm races include the House, Governor, and seats in both the State Senate and House).\n\n4. Finally, party identity. What we learned is that one-size-fits-all, may not apply to liberalism, and that’s okay. For a year now, we’ve all heard the questions: do Democrats need to shift farther left? Is a more centrist approach the way to win back votes? Could a woman head the ticket after the last two female nominees lost on the national stage? Election night 2025 may have proved we were asking the wrong things entirely.\n\nAlright, let me back up. Moderate candidates with strong military and law backgrounds won in Virginia and New Jersey. A highly progressive democratic socialist whose greatest qualification was State Assemblyman took the victory in New York City. A blend of political experience and fresh faces, a mix of extremely liberal and also left-leaning centrist policies were the key to victory across the board. In Pennsylvania it was moderate Democrats that came out on top in almost all races. While these individual candidates all have their strengths, they speak to a bigger message Democrats need to hear: it’s time for the party to embrace its differences. A one-size-fits-all candidate is not going to do as well in all states.\n\nDemocratic leadership needs to acknowledge different platforms are going to be successful in different parts of the country, and the primary process needs to play out. At a time like this, where we are struggling collectively to gain a party identity, closed door meetings are not going to cut it - allowing voters to dictate the future of the party and tell you what resonantes with them will. With this in mind, maybe we should instead be asking how we can field the strongest primary contenders (yes, contenders plural) ahead of 2028.\n\nSo to summarize: this is a win, and it should be treated as such. Seeing blue progress universally, but especially throughout swing states in the midst of such a harmful red agenda is a win. What we can’t do though, is treat this as if the hard work is done. ‘We got the votes out in an off-election year, people are so pissed with Trump, they’ll vote blue up and down the ballot no matter what’ is not a winning attitude. My challenge to Democrats is to remember 2024. Remember the terrifying free fall we all felt after each swing state was called for Trump. Remember questioning what went wrong and what we can do to fix it. The hard work isn’t over, and we now have our marching orders. Let’s go win.",

    content: "We don’t think anyone would disagree with us if we said that in the year since Donald Trump was reelected President while sweeping every swing state and winning the popular vote as a Republican for the first time in 20 years, Democrats have been in a bit of a pickle.\n\nThey’ve been having some money problems, they lack a majority in either chamber and, to address the dying donkey in the room, everyone kinda hates them. Divided between those who think Kamala Harris lost because she was too woke and those who think she lost because she wasn’t woke enough, the Democrats, rather than putting up a united front against a Constitution-chainsawing president, have instead spent their time arguing over pointless zero sum semantics issues like populism vs. abundance (just do both its not that hard).\n\nAll that pessimism has been further compounded by Trump’s effort to rig the midterms through gerrymandering, a situation made all the worse by the Supreme Court’s complete exuberance at the possibility of gutting the Voting Rights Act. As the cherry on top, we also are 30-something-and-counting days into the longest ever government shutdown, one that has left millions of Americans (many of them children, veterans, or disabled people) without food stamps for the month of November. So much for the “pro-life” Republicans.\n\nTo put it mildly, it’s been absolute torture in every imaginable way to be a Democrat recently, so we can forgive any wallowing within bottomless pits of despair over the past year. On November 4th, however, the winds shifted, the tide turned, the crushing feeling of hopelessness, if for a moment, was swept away.\n\nThe reason: Democrats won bigly.\n\nWe should have known it wouldn’t be a normal day when everyone woke up to the news that 43rd President Dick Cheney had passed. Whether that signalled good things or bad things is unclear, but we chose to stay optimistic.\n\nWhen results finally started pouring in that evening, all of us doomsdayers were proven wrong—Democrats not only won, but utterly dominated in almost every conceivable way.\n\nIn the two major gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, Democrats won by margins previously thought unimaginable. Abigail Spanberger clobbered Winsome Earle-Sears with the highest percentage of the vote for a Virginia Democrat since 1961, while in New Jersey polls had had Sherrill up only a couple of points, yet she ended up winning by 13 (another reason never to trust polls ever again).\n\nIt wasn’t just at the top of the ticket too, since in Virginia, Democrats flipped a whopping 13 seats in the House of Delegates and even guy-who-wants-to-kill-Republican-children Jay Jones won with a bigger percentage of the vote in the Attorney General’s race than Kamala Harris herself was able to achieve in the state.\n\nOn the other side of the country, Our Dear Leader/God/Emperor Gavin Newsom got millions of Californians to show up to the polls and stick it to Trump’s attempt at rigging the midterms, passing Proposition 50 by a wider margin than Kamala’s victory in the state and achieving recall election turnout for a simple ballot measure.\n\nEven in random, hyper-low turnout local elections where Republicans have historically had the advantage, Democrats won decisively. Three Democratic Supreme Court Justices were kept on Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court, Mississippi’s Republican supermajority in the State Senate was broken, and Democrats won two statewide elections in Georgia by Jimmy Carter margins.\n\nThis is all before we even get to Zohran Mamdani’s victory over a fake Democrat best known for, in the words of Curtis Sliwa, “slapping fannies and killing grannies.” He pulled off a historic feat by going from 1% in the polls last year to turning out over a million voters to become not only the first Muslim mayor in New York City’s history, but also the first mayor to have a 28-year-old baddie Hinge date wife. It truly was a great night to be a Democrat, the first in a long time.\n\nSo, what does this show?\n\nWe’d like to be very clear in pointing out that this isn’t a signal that Dems are going to sweep the midterms without a shadow of a doubt so we can all just stop tuning in. As much as we’d like to live off of this 2008 Obama-era hopecore forever, it is more important now more than ever to continue to fight back against Trump’s regime and demand strong, effective leadership from Democrats. Of course, Schum will probably find a way to screw this up in the next week, but we can always hope.\n\nMost importantly, we think it drives home just how unpopular Trump’s agenda actually is and how willing people are to oppose it. Ever since Trump took office, Republicans have been taking their 1.5% popular vote victory as permission to do and break anything they want, but, if his disapproval rating is anything to go by, Americans are starting to see past this quackery.\n\nThe economy is stalling, people are struggling to find jobs, and prices haven’t gone down. Sherrill, Mamdani, and Spanberger all ran on affordability, the thing Trump said he was going to focus on before he decided tariffs were the magic answer to everything.\n\nTuesday night felt good, yes, because Democrats won (we here at The Donk! are simple people—we like it when Democrats win), but it’s also because that night was a sign that even in our hyperpolarized environment, Americans are finally starting to agree on something: whatever Trump is doing, we’re not liking it.\n\nSee you next November, Republicans!\n\n",

    content: "“The long, dark night of the end of history has to be grasped not as the terminus of social evolution, but as an enormous opportunity.” - Mark Fisher\n\nOn September 22, 2025, former Vice President and 2024 Democratic Presidential Candidate Kamala Harris singlehandedly saved our democracy in an interview with MSNBC by accusing Donald Trump of being a “communist dictator.” That’s the spirit!\n\nWhile the comment was likely used to critique the authoritarian power abuses of the Trump administration, it’s interesting to hear someone describe Trump as anything close to a “communist.” (Despite Trump orchestrating the US government buying a 10% stake in Intel).\n\nWe could have an entirely different debate on whether existing forms of communism have ever really accomplished its stated goals of doing away with class antagonisms and private property, but the point remains that accusing Trump of wishing to fulfill a Leninist dream is akin to pointing at a dog and swearing up and down that it is, in fact, a horse. They have almost nothing in common. Or do they?\n\nIn his seminal book “Capitalist Realism,” Mark Fisher, a prominent academic in critical theory, described a rising trend in late-stage, global capitalism: everything, including culture, art, and our own mental health, is now completely devoted to capital. There is no deeper meaning behind anything, only the money we can extract from it.\n\nAt first, it can be a bit challenging to see this occurring in our world right now. Previous administrations and presidents have coated this idea of capitalist realism with hollow calls for environmental justice or vain comments on identity politics and individual freedom. Joe Biden did as much in his 2020 campaign–though mostly centrist, some of his policies were progressive in comparison to other establishment Democrats, especially regarding climate change, renewable energy and the furthering of rights and freedoms for marginalized groups.\n\nIt’s true that some of his promises came to fruition, but this is the worst part—the plans didn’t do anything beyond the strict boundaries of capital. In fact, for the past few decades, one could argue that not one real, structural solution has been provided because our problems continue to persist–carbon emissions are still at unsustainable levels, 82% of US energy is non-renewable, and the rights of minorities remain under attack. The true purpose of Joe Biden’s presidency, and of all previous and future administrations within our liberal democracy, is first and foremost to ensure the smooth transfer of capital from the earth to the pockets of the wealthy, and if we’re lucky, the workers. It’ll trickle down one day, right?\n\nTrump, however, had other plans. Instead of playing along with this liberal fantasy of saving the world within the confines of capitalism, Trump called out Biden’s bullshit, and at the same time shouted “fuck YOU in particular!” to every American from the Oval Office.\n\nIt’s not just that Trump doesn’t care about climate change–he doesn’t even acknowledge that it’s real. He described climate change as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.” With this strategy, Trump can continue to worry more about capital accumulation while ignoring a potentially world-ending crisis. Anything for those shareholders, I guess!\n\nTrump is also loud and proud about his relationships with billionaires (and sometimes pornstars)—see how just this April, after Trump pulled the plug on tariffs, he touted how his friend “made $2.5 billion, and he made $900 million! That’s not bad!”\n\nYou’re right Mr. President, that’s not bad, it’s horrible! At least in comparison to the former head of DOGE and Trump situationship Elon Musk, whose net worth currently stands at $500 billion. Did I mention Trump is a billionaire, too? Definitely through hard work alone, not that small loan he received from his father!\n\nBut all of this isn’t to say Trump is only a “crony capitalist.” When someone does all this analysis just to come to that conclusion, they aren’t differentiating Trump from someone like Nancy Pelosi or Crooked Hillary. Establishment politicians have the same pattern of corruption throughout their political careers. Nixon lied to the public to prolong the Vietnam War, George Bush lied about WMDs in Iraq, and yes, Mr. Clinton DID have sexual relations with that woman.\n\nThe important thing is to recognize this corruption and behavior as a unique symptom of late-stage capitalism. In a sense, Trump was the progressive candidate, while Kamala Harris just wanted to maintain the status quo of neoliberal capitalism. Trump saw the crisis spurring within capitalism, and with his proud orange gullet shining bright, decided to redefine and reconstitute capitalism to ensure its continued function. Unfortunately, this renewal of capitalism seems to be teetering towards fascism, whether Trump’s potentially worm-infested brain really understands this or not.\n\nHonestly, as someone on the Left, I cannot forget to thank him: Trump exposed strings of capital controlling nearly every aspect of our government. The old neoliberal lie of a distinct separation of state and private enterprise has been torn apart. Trump has shown us how closely interlinked the wealthy, capitalism and our “democracy” have been all along, without all the bullshit. He has given the Left an enormous opportunity to, for the first time, take hold of the narrative of history, and we cannot let it dissipate.\n\n",

    content: "On Tuesday, the occasionally useful gossip rag Politico published a story about a leaked group chat full of young up-and-coming Republicans that contained numerous racist, sexist, and antisemitic remarks. Celebration of rape, suspicion of jews and support of slavery were among the positions expressed. Many slurs were also said.\n\nThe story has put renewed emphasis on extremism within the Republican Party. Certain Republicans, like Vermont Governor Phil Scott, seemed genuinely disturbed by the comments, while others, like Speaker Mike Johnson, went through the motions of condemnation without much enthusiasm. Some, like our current Vice President, couldn’t have cared less.\n\nWhen I first saw all of this, I immediately thought back to that video a Desantis staffer retweeted a little while back, the one that superimposed his face over an explicit Nazi symbol. That staffer, by the way, is now employed by Eric Schmitt, a senator most notable for saying that America is a country strictly for the descendants of white Christian pioneers.\n\nThe video and the group chat are both indicative of the same problem, which is that the Republicans really seem to have an issue with overt fascism among their younger staff. Of course, not every young Republican is a Nazi, but a lot of them seem to be, and they’re beginning to occupy influential spaces within the GOP.\n\nThis begs the question of why this has happened, especially in regard to the group chat. People don’t start off as Nazis, yet these seemingly run-of-the-mill Republican rank and file happily engage in some of the worst behavior you can think of.\n\nOne could blame this on our current president being reelected in spite of open racism, thus making people feel as if there are no consequences for such behavior. That could certainly be a contributing factor, but these people knew that what they were doing was too much even for today’s lax standards against being a terrible person. One person even texted “If we ever had a leak of this chat we would be cooked fr fr.” Well, it did, and they were.\n\nBesides, to Trump’s minimal credit, he doesn’t indulge in racism to this extreme of a degree. He may have bragged about sexual assault and called bankers Shylocks, but he doesn’t openly fantasize about gas chambers or go around shouting the n-word. The level of horribleness expressed by these group chatters cannot be accounted for by the reelection of Donald Trump alone.\n\nAnother argument could be that this is a product of the broader pendulum swing away from “cancel culture,” an overreaction against leftist purity testing that manifests in a gleeful willingness to say the most outrageous thing one can possibly think of. This is a decent explanation, but I don’t think it tells the whole story, because the mechanism at work here predates even 2020 black square virtue signaling.\n\nWhat we have here is the same strategy by which the people have been converted into Nazism since the Alt-Right became a thing in the late 2000s. These comments may look shocking to the average person, but there’s one place where they’re really not that surprising, where they’re pedestrian even: the internet.\n\nIt should be well known to any college student that the internet seems to function on just about 74 different layers of irony, and that is especially applicable to “dark humor.” This isn’t dark humor as in The Producers, or even jokes with recognizable setups and punchlines. They’re essentially just offensive statements, like “Hitler is cool,” “Jews are bad,” etc.\n\nWrapped in a cloak of irony, you can engage in these taboos while still disavowing the beliefs behind them (it’s just a prank bro). The problem is that such a thing creates cognitive dissonance, and sometimes that dissonance is resolved by coming to believe the horrible stuff you’re saying.\n\nOn the internet, where everyone is anonymous, the effect is amplified. Your statements may keep that unserious tenor, but your beliefs begin to warp to fit in with what you’re saying. With regular people, it all remains a joke, but with people who do the same thing, it becomes a lot more serious (the academic term for which is “Schrödinger’s douchebag”).\n\nOur group chat in question undoubtedly is made up of people who spent a lot of time on the internet when they were younger, because who didn’t? Being an edgy 13-year-old, even an edgy college student, is such a common experience that it’s practically a canon event nowadays, but the expectation is that you’re supposed to get past that kind of stuff as you age.\n\nYou spend enough time in an irony echo chamber, however, and those beliefs can become pretty ingrained. This group chat could be an extreme example, but the people who were raised on the internet are beginning to come into real influence, and some of these irony-poisoned individuals could be making up our next generation of leaders. The 4Chaners are growing up, and into politics they go.\n\n",

    content: "Advil has none other than the President of the United States to thank for its newest ad slogan: The Painkiller That Won’t Give Your Kid Autism!\n\nOn September 22, Donald Trump stood before the White House Press Corps and gave an announcement that would have anyone with even a basic understanding of medicine tilting their head and going “huh?” He claimed that taking acetaminophen while pregnant (or as he pronounced it “acedo-well-let’s-see-how-we-say-that-aceto-minaphin”), sold commercially as Tylenol in the United States, drastically increases the risk of autism in children.\n\nSuch an absurd claim, especially coming off the heels of a years-long pandemic where Trump was notoriously vocal about his lack of trust in traditional medicine, is jarring to say the least. But it’s also worth examining how the hell we got here. What has led us to this moment where such absurd claims seem to be press conference worthy and pseudo-science is accepted as legit by government officials?\n\nLet’s begin with Robert F Kennedy Jr, the current Secretary of Health and Human Services. Aside from his part-time job as a snack for his brain worm, Junior is a decades-long vaccine skeptic, often peddling the debunked conspiracy theory that there is a link between vaccines and autism.\n\nSince accepting his cabinet position, his fear-mongering has manifested everywhere from Junior claiming the government should not mandate MMR (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) vaccines, to a change in COVID booster regulations that make it more difficult for pregnant women and healthy children to get the shot.\n\nVaccines, medical technology that have been successfully used since 1796, are suddenly under attack because of this abstract and unproven fear they cause autism. It’s also worth noting that Junior has no formal medical training or higher degree.\n\nMoving onto the man under Junior, FDA Commissioner, Marty Makary M.D., M.P.H.. Makary has an impressive medical background, practicing surgical oncology at Johns Hopkins University as a tenured member of faculty, but he rose to prominence by completely disregarding all of that and attacking the medical industry instead. He has published several books about everything from price gouging by insurance companies to common research practices and their outcome on clinical advice. The man has literally made a name for himself by attacking the medical establishment.\n\nHis more interesting claims include that the US food supply is poison, the government is the “greatest perpetrator of misinformation” about COVID and fluoride and pesticides and residual antibiotics in drinking water are contributing to rising rates of infertility. These are all facets of American health and safety that, at some point or another, ran through the FDA, which he now is in charge of (*looks to camera*).\n\nOnce Makary’s position within the FDA was secured, he announced plans for a “New FDA,” one that would be partnering with biotech companies and big pharma to expedite drug testing processes, implementing AI to ensure best practice medicine and getting rid of “avoidable delays.” Makary has gone on as FDA Commissioner to attribute autism to a range of environmental factors (stopping just short of including inoculation in that list) and defend RFK’s claims about vaccines by saying his statements have been misconstrued (I’m like, pretty sure Junior has gotten his point across loud and clear though). Makary has not yet publicly commented on the White House’s supposed link between Tylenol and autism.\n\nOK pause. After a year’s long pandemic, with a President openly mocking health and safety guidelines (think masks, hydroxychloroquine, “bringing the light inside the body”), onto the stage steps a known vaccine skeptic with no formal medical training. He tears a new one to “the establishment,” bringing us to question even basic practices in American medicine and making us collectively think that doctors, researchers, big pharma, or at least someone is colluding against us.\n\nVaccines cause autism. Your water is being poisoned. Our food is giving us genetic diseases. Suddenly, we have an American public that is primed to believe this. After all, we just lost 1.2 million people in this country to a deadly infectious disease. Maybe traditional medical practices did make that worse. Maybe they have failed us. It couldn’t possibly be the absolute disaster-class in governance we witnessed during that public health emergency that led to undue suffering and death.\n\nAnd the most brilliant thing that RFK could possibly do with this American audience ready to believe him, he does—he brings in a second-in-command who can add validity to his claims through his formal medical background while bringing his own academic branded skepticism to the fight against conventional medicine and science. Now we are partnering with the establishments of formal medicine like corporate pharma and biotech to build medicine back better! Make America Healthy Again!\n\nSo now…autism causes vaccines? Vaccines cause autism? Tylenol can also do you in? Who knows. Ya know what else apparently causes Autism? Circumcision! Yes, another real thing RFK said. Apparently infants who are given Tylenol following circumcision are more likely to develop autism. The conspiracy rabbit holes that have suddenly been given validity are vast. So, what is important to keep in mind as we navigate a world in which a man who dumped a dead bear cub in Central Park is suddenly our Secretary of Health and Human Services? I’m so glad you asked.\n\nOne of the most important things we can do is acknowledge that this whole thing reeks of ableism. Autism is not some kind of deadly disease, and the vast majority of autistic people are able to live normal and healthy lives. The disinformation about both vaccines being harmful and autism being some kind of life-ending diagnosis is leading to children contracting legitimately horrible, painful, deadly diseases. You would rather have your child suffer from the life-altering side effects of polio (assuming they even survive the initial infection) than allow them a vaccine an untrained ex-coccaine addict thinks might be dangerous? How 1950s of you!\n\nSecond of all, medical guidelines exist for a reason. Painstaking trials and in many cases, decades of research have gone into creating good practice medicine. Data can’t be erased by doubt. Additionally, the researchers and healthcare professionals who provide care and devote their lives to discovering treatments are not monsters. Your everyday lab tech, nurse or doctor are doing their best to provide care the best way science has shown us how.\n\nIt is also important to understand that our medical system is far from perfect. Price gouging, insurance companies and corporate interests have all made the system harder to navigate, more expensive and sadly, out of reach for many. However, that doesn’t magically make all medicine invalid. We should be challenging the institutions that make healthcare inaccessible, not the science that makes healthcare possible.\n\nAnd finally, just to say I said it, vaccines and Tylenol do not cause autism.",

    content: "TO BE CLEAR, THE DONK THINKS POLITICAL VIOLENCE IS BAD, LIKE REALLY BAD. PLEASE DO NOT SHOOT PEOPLE YOU DISAGREE WITH. OK SO PLEASE DON’T HUNT US DOWN THANK YOU!\n\nThe seemingly daily call for thoughts and prayers has hit the airwaves after Charlie Kirk was assassinated doing what he loved most—using his voice to defend the Second Amendment.\n\nAgain, we were not thinking and praying for this in the slightest. Shooting people is bad, whether the bullet comes from an ICE agent, a woke leftie, or from a 4chan chronically online incel. I feel for his young children, and mourn for his friends and family who lost a loved one, regardless of how much of an asshole he was. But amidst all the decrying of political violence from across the political spectrum is a curious tendency to overlook the outright violent politics of the Charlie Kirk brand of MAGAism, and how that’s somehow become an accepted form of political expression.\n\nSome of you have probably seen Ezra Klein libbing out on the New York Times, claiming that Kirk was “practicing politics in exactly the right way” and that he “envied what [Kirk] built.” It’s not just him, either. The Dems, in their infinite finesse and wisdom, spent 72 hours following the incident in Utah tripping over themselves to call Kirk a champion of free speech, the voice of a generation, a committed debater dedicated to the truth, etc…\n\nAnd it kind of just makes me feel like an insane QAnon conspiracy theorist, because like, are we watching the same videos? Hearing the same public remarks? Reading the same publications from TP-USA and its satellite companies?\n\nIt’s quite telling to me that directly quoting him is somehow seen as “attacking his memory” or “not the right time,” but I’m going to do it anyway. It’s the man who said Jewish people control “not just the colleges” but also the “nonprofits, the movies, Hollywood, all of it.” It’s the man who said passing the Civil Rights Act was a mistake, and that Black people were better under slavery. It’s the man who had his company compile a “watchlist” of “woke” professors for people online to be able to doxx and harass.\n\nIs this, O Wise Democratic Establishment, the right kind of politics? Is this the kind of discourse and rhetoric we take as good, honest political debate? Is this what we are accepting as valid, evidence-based political opinion? Is this level of overt intolerance, of misinformation and reactionism, of hate and chaos and lies now what politics in this country is? As far as I can tell, the only line Kirk didn’t cross was literally taking an AR-15 and mowing down the left-leaning 18 year olds he talked to, and somehow that’s enough to crown him the king of free speech and debate?\n\nThe most terrifying part of this has been the absolute next-level INSANITY of the American Right in their reaction to the assassination. I genuinely do not even know where to begin. We have literal members of the U.S. House of Representatives claiming that the shooter was a transgender person using a slur, but then calling for some good ol’ Ts&Ps when it was discovered to be a white guy. We have more people on social media, INCLUDING THE ACTUAL VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, making watchlists of people who tweeted things about Kirk they didn’t like, and calling their employers to get them fired from their jobs. And then we have our good pal DJT, who seemed to forget that his good friend was just killed and opted to talk about the ongoing construction of his White House Big Beautiful Ballroom.\n\nLike….literally what is going on?\n\nCan I level with you, dear reader, for a second? When I was born in the 21st century, I assumed that my subscription to life was to a more or less tolerant society, one that left the days of burning witches behind no matter how heated political debate got at times. Yet, here we are with a dude who is hailed as the “moderate leveling voice in Republican politics” calling on white Christian men to arm themselves against their fellow Americans, and advocating for those who cross the southern border to be shot on sight.\n\nThere is a deep, fundamental understanding of violence in the message that Kirk peddled. To accept this, to think this is simply what it means to be conservative in this day and age, is a betrayal of those whom Democrats claim to care about, and even a betrayal of what it means to have a functional conservative party. To lay over and let hate and authoritarianism be construed into a cultural norm is devastatingly dangerous and leaves the fabric of American liberal democracy more frayed and fragile than ever.\n\nA tolerant society must be intolerant of violent politics, whether through guns or through speech. The minute we lose this, we lose everything else.",

    content: "Yesterday, Australia’s main right-wing party completely imploded. Imagine the Republican Party suddenly splitting into two separate MAGA and center-right parties, and you’d start to grasp the scale of this momentous event. For over 80 years, Australia’s right-wing party has operated as a coalition between the urban Liberal Party and the rural National Party—a political marriage of convenience that, until now, held firm through decades of elections. That is, until Donald Trump smashed it to pieces from across the Pacific. The consequences of this spectacular collapse offer a cautionary tale for not only Australia, but for the US and the rest of the world.\n\nTo understand how this happened, let’s rewind to mid-2023.\n\nThe dominant issue at the heart of Australian politics was the Indigenous Voice to Parliament, a proposal to enshrine an indigenous advisory board into the Constitution. Backed by the left-wing Labor party and prominent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders, it was seen as a long-overdue step to restorative justice. In a country with a history of paternalistic policies (google the 2007 Intervention for an example), The Voice promised Indigenous people a say in decisions that affected them. In early 2023, voters agreed this legislation was needed: The Voice had around 70% approval.\n\nBut as a constitutional amendment, it needed a majority of voters and states to pass.\n\nThe Coalition, still sore from losing the 2022 election, saw an opportunity to claw their way back into relevance. Conservative money poured into PR groups like Advance Australia, which launched the aggressive “If You Don’t Know, Vote No” campaign. Rupert Murdoch-owned News Corp, with an almost monopoly on print and news media (think Succession), pumped out anti-Voice messaging nonstop.\n\nShockingly, relentless misinformation campaigns from the biggest media monopoly in the country worked. Public support tanked. On October 14, 2023, 60% of voters voted No to The Voice.\n\nWiping the dust from his cheeks and astonishingly smooth scalp, leader of the Coalition and Voldemort cosplayer Peter Dutton wielded a wide smirk. He pinned The Voice’s failure as the Labor Party’s failure. Before the referendum, Labor led the Coalition by 10 points in national polling. The Coalition now left Labor in the dust by 10 points.\n\nMoving into 2024, the Coalition swept local and state elections across the country. The narrative was set: a conservative comeback was inevitable. The Labor government was stumbling, and the Right had found its voice—just not The Voice. It was surely impossible to fumble this guaranteed victory.\n\n\n\nThen came November 5th, 2024. The day the people of the United States of America decided to re-elect Donald Trump as their President, again. Trump’s victory signalled a global resurgence of a new populist, far-right inspired by the MAGA movement. You might assume this would be good news for Australia’s Right. Right?\n\nSalivating from across the Pacific, the Coalition certainly thought it was. Dutton announced his new election platform that read like Trump fanfiction. Like the US, Australia too needed a Department of Government Efficiency. He proposed tackling ‘wasteful spending’, sacking 41,000 federal workers, and banning work-from-home for government employees. Of course, this demanded an Elon Musk-equivalent overseer, a role filled by ultra-conservative mining-billionaire Gina Reinhardt. Following in MAGA’s footsteps, Dutton promised to de-woke education, overhauling the school curriculums to prevent teachers from “indoctrinating” students.\n\nAnd for a brief moment, it looked like this political platform might actually work. Trump’s popularity soared. Polls showed him at 54% approval. His sweeping “mandate” seemed untouchable.\n\nLike a bottle of milk left in the Queensland sun, things turned sour. By March, Americans had turned on Trump’s reckless policies, dropping below 50% support. His economy-wrecking tariffs, DOGE cuts, and deranged foreign policy—from withdrawing support in Ukraine to literally threatening to invade Canada—caused widespread chaos.\n\nLike the rest of the world, anti-Trump resentment in Australia escalated. Trump announced a 10% tariff on Australian goods, with an even steeper tariff on Australian beef. Trump’s beef with Australia (no pun intended) was justified on its longstanding ban on US beef imports. However, the rationale for this is tenuous at best. The ban, in place since 2003, stems from the US repeatedly failing shared biosecurity standards on Mad Cow Disease.\n\nTrump was a slap to the face. Just a few years earlier, Australia signed the $90 billion AUKUS nuclear submarine deal and ditched its previous agreement with France. Now, a supposed “ally” was ditching its relationship with Australia. News stories about the domestic political turmoil in the US reached Australian shores, terrifying voters.\n\nTrump appeared as an immediate threat to the Coalition. Originally embracing a Trump-adjacent platform, the Coalition now desperately attempted to distance itself from him. On April 6th, Dutton labelled its previous endorsement of proposed DOGE cuts as “a mistake.” Just two days before the election, Dutton announced he would drop his promise to end wokeness in schools. All that remained of the right’s platform was an unpopular nuclear energy policy.\n\nAnd just like that, what was before an inevitable victory for the Coalition turned into a whopping defeat. On the 3rd of May, Australians voted decisively to turn away from the Coalition. The Coalition lost 10 seats in the House of Representatives. Labor now had 77 seats to just 53 Coalition seats: an overwhelming landslide. Party leader and professional egg-head Peter Dutton even lost his own seat—Humpty Dumpty had a great fall, and no amount of Gina Reinhardt’s money could put him back together again.\n\nInterestingly, this landslide was less of a Labor victory than it was a Coalition loss. Only a third of voters put Labor first, but thanks to Australia’s preferential voting system and massive anti-Coalition backlash, Labor absolutely cleaned the floor.\n\nThe damage was done. After Dutton exited the Coalition, the new leaders of the MAGA-aligned National Party, David Littleproud, and the traditional-right Liberal Party, Susan Ley, pointed fingers at each other. Ultimately, the Coalition that was so entrenched in Australian politics fell apart on May 20 after Littleproud announced that the Nationals needed to go on a “journey of rediscovery.” It's giving college breakup: they just need some “time apart” to “focus on themselves.”\n\nSo what lessons can be learned from the dramatic Trump-fueled downfall of the Australian right?\n\nFirst of all, Trump’s radical foreign policy shifts and backstabbing of allies are deeply resented internationally. Long-time US allies, like Australia, are now rethinking those ties in light of Trump’s erratic behavior. America First means everyone else last. The political backlash in Australia demonstrates that when the US abandons its allies, conservative parties in those countries—especially those aligning with Trump—pay the price at the polls.\n\nSecondly, contrary to media narratives, Trump style-populism is not universally appealing. While right-wing populists in Europe, like Nigel Farage’s Reform party in the UK have gained traction, attempts to mimic MAGA policies in Australia and Canada have been thoroughly extinguished. In both countries, recent elections saw voters dismissing culture-war obsessions and authoritarian promises that define far-right populism.\n\nFinally, we are entering an unprecedented global political era. Traditional party coalitions, norms, and stability are fracturing around the world. In Australia, a third of voters voted outside the two-party system. MAGA may have sparked the global far-right populist wave, but ironically, Trump’s own influence could be what ultimately unravels it. Is Trump now undoing the very movement he helped ignite?\n\n",

    content: "Well folks, we have done it once again. In an astonishingly unsurprising turn of events, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has made the brilliant decision to die on the hill of the status quo establishment that has gotten us absolutely murdered in nearly every metric imaginable.\n\nA few days ago, the DNC’s Credentials Subcommittee recommended redoing the election that got March for Our Lives cofounder David Hogg and Pennsylvania State Representative Malcom Kenyatta their vice chair positions. Hogg immediately took to his fundraising Mailchimp to claim that this was a retaliation against his criticisms of the Democratic establishment, while Kenyatta opted for Instagram reels to call bullshit and flex how many more votes he got compared to Hogg. So yes, this discourse is already taking place at the highest level of intelligence and professionalism. But in the spirit of civic responsibility (and maybe just a dash of masochism), I figured I’d try to break it all down with a little more nuance.\n\nThere are basically two separate plotlines happening simultaneously in the painfully-mediocre-Netflix-show-with-seventeen-too-many-seasons saga that is the DNC. The first involves Hogg’s divisive stance on the DNC’s role in influencing Democratic primaries around the country, while the second involves the general incompetence of the DNC in reading their own bylaws. As much as I’d like to forget the DNC exists (like most people who subject themselves to the cosmic horror that is American politics), I believe this situation is an important case study in how gravely the DNC misunderstands what it stands for, and what the American people need and want from the Democratic party. So, let’s get into it.\n\nOkay, Plotline A. Hogg is the cofounder of an organization called Leaders We Deserve, which argues that Democrats with one foot in the grave have gotten too comfortable with holding safe seats in Congress without really doing much of anything. The organization aims to primary these Democrats with young, progressive candidates that have new ideas to bring to the party as a whole. \n\nI  personally think this is a great idea, but the problems came when Hogg actually got the Vice Chair position. On becoming an officer of the DNC, many expected Hogg to lessen his involvement in the Leaders We Deserve organization, but he did not. As Ken Martin pointed out on X when criticizing this decision, the ability for the entire national party mechanism to put their thumb on the scale and throw resources behind specific candidates defeats the purpose of free and fair primary elections. Now, what also defeats the purpose of free and fair primary elections is corporate special interest groups doing the exact same thing, but maybe that’s too advanced of an idea for Democratic politicians to internalize.\n\nNow, Plotline B. The vote to fill the three Vice Chair positions was held in February, and the first several rounds had Artie Blanco, an advocacy leader from Nevada, winning her chair handily. After that, though, the votes for the last two Vice Chair positions took literally forever—I’m talking like literally hours upon hours of voting without any candidate reaching the necessary threshold to win the seats. In the DNC’s infinite wisdom, they decided to simply slap Hogg and Kenyatta on the same ballot, lower the threshold for the amount of votes needed, and conveniently overlook the 50/50 gender quota that is written into the DNC’s bylaws. Apparently no one at the DNC can do basic math, because that very obviously gave both Hogg and Kenyatta a numerical advantage over the other candidates. If you know me IRL, you know the face I’m making right now as I’m writing this. If not, just picture the “thousand yard stare” meme, because…yeah.\n\nThis is where our two stories combine. Oklahoma activist Kalyn Free, a losing candidate for the vice chair position, filed a complaint to the DNC Bylaws Committee claiming the election was improperly conducted and demanded a redo, definitely because she cares about the rules and not because she lost the election. Hogg started posting about how this is because the DNC hates him even though the complaint was filed before he started going hard for Leaders We Deserve, and Kenyatta responded by saying that this was super hard for him because the media is giving Hogg all the attention even though Kenyatta got more votes (seriously, he will not let you forget it).\n\nReally, at the end of the day, this story probably won’t matter at all to that many people. Even I, a certified politics nerd who has nothing better to do than to stay updated on this drama, couldn’t really tell you the name of any previous DNC Vice Chair, mostly because the position doesn’t do much of anything. I think it’s worth mentioning, though, because it just shows us how fundamentally broken the Democratic Party as an institution is.\n\nKids are being shipped off to countries they’ve never heard of without due process. Families can’t get food on the table because Donald Trump is more interested in a dick measuring contest with Xi Jinping than coming up with a real legislative agenda (happy Pride, everyone). Women are dying across the country because they’ve been denied life-saving abortions and can’t take off work to drive 13 hours to a blue state.\n\nIn the face of all of this, the DNC is falling over themselves tweaking out over their bylaws while hemorrhaging voters literally from their own base.\n\n\n\nI’m a Democrat. I care deeply about progressive values, strongly oppose MAGAism and ultra-conservatism, and fight with everything I have to be a representative of what this party should stand for in my own community. But when this cowardly, tepid clown show is our last stand against the rapid onset of fascism in America, I honestly can’t blame anyone for not wanting to vote for us.\n\n",

    content: "… Is a human right. Right?\n\nApparently not.\n\nOne of the bluest states in America struggles with the ability to provide basic shelter, let alone affordable housing, to thousands of its residents. Illinois has a 66% Democratic State Legislature, a 68% Democratic State Senate… and had a 116% increase in its unhoused population between 2023 and 2024. Though much of this increase can be attributed to new arrivals in the Prairie State, 7.23% of kids in Chicago Public Schools in the 2022-2023 school year were experiencing homelessness, compared to a national average of 2.8%. Three cheers for Democratic leadership!\n\nSince the 2024 election (and frankly, long before that), it has been easy to feel disappointed, betrayed, and enraged at some of the Democratic Party’s choices. Every headline nowadays is a new grain of salt in a wound that cuts into our families, our futures and our ability to live the lives we choose. Those kind souls who assured us that the effects of the Trump administration wouldn’t reach us too quickly in this Democrat-trifecta state were telling a (red) white (and mostly blue) lie. In an era that is already defined by daily tragedy, any failure by Democrats feels magnified - it feels personal. Even when it’s not.\n\nHowever, there are some good things happening in Oz. State Representative Kevin Olickal recently introduced a simple but effective (dare I say - common sense) bill that would help protect the fundamental rights of the unhoused: House Bill 1429. If passed, HB1429 would prohibit any form of local government in Illinois from fining, arresting or penalizing unhoused persons for performing life-sustaining activities on public property. In the wake of Grants Pass v. Johnson, a Supreme Court case that essentially allows states to criminalize homelessness, this bill would help prevent such atrocities from becoming routine in Illinois. HB1429 is basic in its aim, but true: it protects the rudimentary rights of unhoused persons and would alleviate the immense burden that criminalizing homelessness imposes on taxpayers.\n\nSo if Gen Z has to come of age in a reality that burns a fresh hell of headlines into our eyes every morning under leadership that passes along buckets of water slowly, if at all, to save us from the inferno, the only thing left for us to do is to get to work. Fortunately for you, dear reader, the totally super duper badass UChicago Democrats Housing Policy Caucus made that work incredibly easy. In one click, this link brings you to a letter campaign that takes only thirty seconds to fill out, which then automatically sends a letter to your Illinois State Representative, asking them to support this vital piece of legislation.\n\n\n\nSo, it takes thirty seconds for you to click this link and sign the letter campaign. It takes one minute for you to post the QR code below on your story so that your friends can tell their state rep to do the right thing. It takes another thirty seconds to put the link in a few group chats to get the word out.\n\n\n\nSo, it would take you two minutes total to support a bill that would protect basic human rights. It takes less than the same amount of time to brush your teeth, do your hair, or ghost your Autumn Quarter situationship.\n\nDo you have two minutes?\n\n",

    content: "December 1st, 2024, marked a joyous occasion for the American public as a hard-fought battle against treacherous forces had finally reached its end. Donald Trump had won the American presidential election, prompting future “First Friend” Elon Musk to declare triumphantly, “Cancel Culture has been Canceled.”\n\nOf course, this statement was the cause of much celebration. However, I am not too sure what an “end to Cancel Culture” actually entails. Musk, as usual, does little to illuminate the subject and neglects to mention how he has canceled Cancel Culture or what Cancel Culture even is.\n\nBased on Google search data, interest in Cancel Culture peaked in 2021, and interest has been waning since, so if Cancel Culture is just talking about Cancel Culture, then Musk may be correct. However, self-described “white advocate” and “proud Islamophobe” former Infowars reporter Laura Loomer disagreed, citing her banning on Instagram, Lyft and Cashapp as apparent evidence of Cancel Culture at work. With a situation so complex and dire, we need to go deeper to truly understand the effect of Cancel Culture and how this spectre has seemingly haunted American culture for years.\n\nWhat is Cancel Culture?\n\nTo begin my journey in understanding American culture’s great existential threat, I consulted the most prestigious American news outlets. Results varied: CNN reports that “Cancel Culture, as it’s understood today, isn’t real.” Vice reports Cancel Culture to be “the act of collective boycotting of something or someone after a perceived wrongdoing.” One particularly entertaining piece in the Chicago Thinker cites Hydra’s surveillance and spying in Captain America: The Winter Soldier as being the embodiment of Cancel Culture. One Fox News opinion piece reports Cancel Culture to be “a group of grievance hunters who police traditional sources of joy for potential offenses.” So, one thing is certain: Cancel Culture is defined by public action against a person or “source of joy.”\n\nThat then made me wonder: what actions fall under the umbrella of Cancel Culture? According to Elon Musk, cancel culture is “trying to stop freedom of speech” and “infringe on people’s personal freedom.” During his 2020 acceptance of the Republican nomination, Donald Trump identified Cancel Culture as making “decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated and driven from society as we know it.” Based on this definition, we can infer that Cancel Culture is any action that attempts to limit a person’s freedom of speech by attacking their livelihood (via firing) or attempting to ostracize them from society (deplatforming).\n\nPopular Instances of Cancel Culture\n\nGiven the broadness of our definition, it is probably helpful to see some examples of it happening to understand why everyone is so worried. This makes the outrage even more confusing, however, because in terms of pop culture, many cancelled celebrities are simply not affected by their cancellation.\n\nFor example, according to this list of 25 Celebrities Canceled by Gen-Z, there are actual criminals such as Sean “Diddy” Combs, Russell Brand, Chris Brown and Johnathan Majors. Alongside these rapists and domestic abusers, you have some of the most successful people in the world such as billionaire Elon Musk, the second most popular artist globally The Weekend, 2025 Grammy award winner for best comedy album Dave Chappelle, and most watched amateur boxer Jake Paul. Has anybody told these people they’re canceled? I don’t think they know.\n\nConservatives are quick to cite bannings on social media as evidence of Cancel Culture, such as when Canadian Psychologist and political commentator Jordan Peterson declared that he “would rather die” than delete a transphobic tweet. On social media, supporters of Donald Trump are more likely to be banned on platforms, however, the evidence shows that this occurs because they are more likely to spread disinformation (I’m shocked). In fact, research shows that claims of conservative censorship in social media are false.\n\nIn terms of America’s college campuses, where mobs of progressives are said to be eager to expel conservative voices, there are also surprisingly few cases of professors being deplatformed or fired. According to the National Association of Scholars in their article tracking Cancel Culture on college campuses, out of 294 cancellation events, only about 4 involved deplatforming or firing. Not quite the cultural epidemic we’ve been led to believe has been taking over college campuses en masse.\n\nRepublican Cancel Culture\n\nAfter Jordan Peterson’s temporary ban from Twitter, he declared, “Up Yours Woke Moralists, We’ll See Who Cancels Who!” His words have turned eerily prophetic, as Republicans appear to be the ones actually perpetrating modern Cancel Culture.\n\nElon Musk himself has begun the process of silencing left-wing voices on X as he bans multiple journalists from the platform for the crime of criticizing him in writing. Prominent anti-fascist researchers and organizers have been quietly removed without notification or explanation. Even protests against authoritarian governments are not safe from Canceling, as Musk has been collaborating with Turkey’s authoritarian government to silence students’ accounts.\n\nThe Trump administration has targeted college campuses as international students have had their visas revoked for writing op-eds or engaging in legal acts of protest.  If being snatched by a plain clothes ICE officer and imprisoned isn’t attacking their livelihood, I don’t know what is.\n\nTrump has also made a show of firing several Democrat aligning board members of regulatory agencies. The National Credit Union Administration, National Labor Relations Board and Federal Trade Commission have all been targeted in firings that “undermine democracy and blatantly ignore Congress and our democratic values.” Beyond regulatory commissions, mass layoffs of federal workers are expected to fire at least 12% of the 2.4 million federal workers, including 220,000 workers put on a probationary period. These probationary period firings have been described by American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley as “targeting employees not because of performance but because they were hired before Trump took office.” Didn’t Donald Trump say that fear of being fired for political beliefs is one of the worst aspects of Cancel Culture?\n\nClearly, Republican Cancel Culture has blown progressive Cancel Culture out of the water as, under the Trump Administration, your immigration status, job and social platform access are dependent on your political leanings.\n\nConclusion\n\nSince the requirements for an action to be considered Cancel Culture are so vague, it has been allowed to exist as a progressive boogeyman for years. Virtually any public pushback against anyone on a political basis could be interpreted as Cancel Culture, and it’s apparent that prominent Republicans believe themselves to be common victims.\n\nHowever, actual cases of progressive Cancel Culture are few and far between. Cancel Culture and the negative connotations it has are entirely manufactured by conservative voices to create a feeling of oppression against them. The legions of “canceled” celebrities on primetime TV attest to the fact that a successful cancellation from progressives is rare.\n\nOn the other hand, there is an abundance of examples of Conservative Cancel Culture as students, federal workers and activists are deplatformed and fired for political beliefs. These aren’t cases of somebody saying something racist and maybe seeing some mean tweets. These are lives being upended because of valid and (supposedly) legally protected political expression.\n\nCancel Culture was never cancelled, because progressives were never the ones most effectively using it. The true “Cancel Culture” Americans should live in fear of is not in the form of tweets and mean words, but political retaliation for free speech from the President of the United States himself.\n\n",

    content: "The year is 1997. Thousands of venture capitalists, computer scientists and software engineers flock en masse to Silicon Valley, the epicenter of the dot-com bubble driving the US economy. Among them is a young Peter Thiel, a cunning law student-turned-investor, armed with a small $1 million investment from friends and family. He poured it into a small tech startup called Confinity, which developed novel software for online money transfers. In 2002, Confinity merged with X.com, a competing start-up by apartheid-nepo-baby Elon Musk. The resulting company, PayPal, was later sold to eBay for over $1.5 billion.\n\nThe founders and early engineers of PayPal, who exchanged ideas, code and likely many lines of ketamine, have since become some of the wealthiest and most influential men in the world. Known as the “PayPal Mafia,” they went on to found or lead tech companies like YouTube, LinkedIn, Yelp, Tesla and SpaceX, as well as major investment firms like Sequoia Capital.\n\nHowever, their ambitions have long since eclipsed technology and finance—many now seek direct influence over the government. Peter Thiel, the de facto leader of the PayPal Mafia, bankrolled the rise of Vice President JD Vance. Musk bought Twitter to artificially fuel far-right misinformation and help re-elect President Donald Trump. The Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Trump 2.0, guided by Musk and Thiel, has chaotically slashed funding all over the Federal Government, from the Department of Education to USAID to the National Park Service.\n\nMany commentators have rightly pointed out that the so-called “PayPal Mafia” seeks government influence purely for personal gain. For instance, Musk—whose companies have received at least $38 billion in federal contracts and subsidies—is now cutting those very subsidies in ways that help preserve his market dominance by disadvantaging competitors. Moreover, Musk and Trump have benefited from government-sponsored rugpulls of their “meme” cryptocurrencies.\n\nBut behind this blatant conflict of interest lies a deeper question: why the hell do these men, already worth tens and hundreds of billions of dollars, want even more control? The answer lies in a radical, ultra-techno-libertarian ideology—one that rejects democracy and government itself.\n\nIn 2009, Peter Thiel authored an article for the Cato Institute arguing that he “no longer [believes] freedom and democracy are compatible,” calling for libertarians to “find an escape from politics in all its forms.” Essentially, Thiel believes that the liberal democratic nation-state as we know it today has failed. Instead, he posits we can “escape” from this system in three ways: “Cyberspace, Outerspace and Seastedding.”\n\nThe last two methods sound like something out of a generic science-fiction movie. Outerspace refers to, quite literally, escaping the Earth by extra-terrestrial settlement through “commercializing space” (hence Musk’s obsession with “Occupying Mars”). Seasteading involves creating floating, lawless, libertarian city-states within international waters. Thiel has already donated $500,000 to the Seasteading Institute, founded by Milton Friedman’s grandson, Patri Friedman. Others, like pro-Trump tech venture capitalists Marc Andreesen and Ben Horowitz, are funding similar projects on land, such as the California Forever Project: a planned exclusive, luxury city of 400,000 people north of the Bay Area in Solano County.\n\nBut the most relevant “exit strategy” to the tech industry is through cyberspace: creating “virtual communities not bounded by historical nation-states.” Building upon early PayPal and Bitcoin dreams of ending “monetary sovereignty,” today’s tech elites envision virtual states using Metaverse-like technology and cryptocurrency. Or, to put it simply, making the dystopian plot of Ready Player One reality.\n\nCrypto-millionaire Balaji Srinivasan—former employee of Andreessen Horowitz, co-investor with Peter Thiel in the steroid-fueled Olympics alternative ‘the Enhanced Games’, and self-proclaimed futurist—lays out a clearer version of this vision in his recent book The Network State. In it, Srinivasan predicts that a “second American Civil War” will erupt between the federal government and Bitcoin billionaires (yes, he seriously believes this), after which a new system of “Network States” will take hold. These states, built on the concept of “volitional recentralization,” are virtual-physical societies where citizenship is entirely opt-in, selective and conditional. Individuals apply to join communities aligned with their values, governed by their own laws, police, currencies and social contracts. Srinivasan claims this model solves the “tyranny of the majority” by arguing that if you dislike the rules of one Network State, you can simply leave and join another—treating citizenship like switching streaming service.\n\nYikes, doesn’t this sound like a Black Mirror episode?\n\nIn reality, this turns society itself into a commodity on a free-market to be bought and sold by the consumer. Governance becomes a subscription model. By emphasizing exit rather than participation, citizens of a network state lose all democratic input within their society. It is designed to sidestep the “inconveniences” of democratic compromise, politics and government, instead envisioning a crypto-feudalist, dystopian, Hobbessian nightmare.\n\nWhile these ideas may sound like delusions concocted by ketted-up megalomaniacs, we must recognize that this ideology is no longer at the fringes of society. Instead, the people who share this ideology, the PayPal Mafia, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Balaji Srinivasan, are strong influences within Trump 2.0. If we don’t recognize and resist this ideology for what it is—a calculated assault on the idea of government itself—we risk waking up in a society where public institutions are dismantled in favor of corporate kingdoms ruled by unaccountable billionaires, democracy is an in-app purchase for those rich enough to afford it, and society itself becomes a commodity.\n\n",

    content: "In elementary school, I knew this one kid whom I hated. He would make jokes during class, tease my friends, and occasionally eat glue. I would roll my eyes every time he spoke up or passed me in the halls, often wandering the other direction if we were headed the same way. That was, until my best friend befriended him. She got to know him and eventually began to learn Spanish after finding out he was initially from Mexico. She spoke with him every day, getting better at speaking the language he held close to his heart. Until one day, he wasn’t at school—the next day, he wasn’t either. This continued for the rest of the school year. She was heartbroken when she found out he would not be returning for middle school and even more heartbroken that he had not told her.\n\nWe all had that classmate we hated, maybe you still do. If only then I knew the true gravity of the situation, maybe I would have stopped hating him after he left, maybe I would have cut him some slack. But, alas, how does one expect a ten-year-old to grasp the concept of a random kid in her class randomly disappearing one day? It wasn’t until my senior year of high school that my very same friend, the one I was best friends with in elementary school, a girl whom I had drifted apart from, came up to me and told me what had happened was that he was deported back to Mexico. I never found out why; I honestly just left it as a passing conversation.\n\nNow, however, I am sitting in Ex Libris, my favorite study place at UChicago, looking around and wondering how my fellow peers, students, and friends that I see beside me could very well have their student visas taken away tomorrow. How the girl on my right, wearing wired headphones, listening to what I presume is some heavy beat remix by the tap of her foot, could have written an article against Trump that puts her in jeopardy of being deported back to a place that she hasn’t seen since she was the ripe age of one.\n\nThe other day, I spoke to a friend in my math class. I told her about the seven students who were reported as having their student visas revoked, as if it were simply lunch money being taken from a bully. Being from Canada, she was immediately shocked. She spoke about how she didn’t know what had happened, about how she was on a student visa, and how she doesn’t know what she would do should that happen to her, because her parents work in the United States.\n\nThen, we sat in silence for the remainder of the class. I was left to think about how someone could have such a monumental, life-changing difficulty sprung on them one Wednesday afternoon, sitting in a coffee shop. How one day I may not see that friend in math anymore, and how hurt my best friend must have been when my elementary school enemy disappeared in the middle of the school year.\n\nThis is the impact we are left to ponder when the entire stability of the political system is left up in the air under Donald Trump. How is it fair that one day someone could wake up in their dorm and proceed to have a lovely day on campus, and then the next day they have to pack up and leave? How is it fair that people's best friends, loved ones, and family could be ripped away from them simply because, as stated by the American Civil Liberties Union, Donald Trump deems them as “poisoning the blood of our country”? Where is the humanity in shipping criminals to a camp in El Salvador that PBS News states is filled with “systematic physical beatings, torture, [and] intentional denial of access to food, water, clothing, healthcare”? Where is the humanity in dropping someone off at a random street in Mexico?\n\nThat’s exactly it—there is no humanity or empathy with Donald Trump as the President of the United States. It is hard to hear even when someone you barely know is deported from the United States, let alone a family member, friend, or classmate. However, nothing will change until we all speak up and fight for what is fair for every person in the United States, citizen or not—an unalienable right to due process, a basic respect for human dignity, and a share of the promise and opportunity that this country is supposed to represent.\n\n",

    content: "Last Wednesday afternoon, intrepid Sidechatters and those who bother to follow the University Student Government (USG) on Instagram were alerted to a surprising statement—that very night, a special “emergency meeting” was to be held. Smuggled in among the rest of the agenda items was a blunt phrase with little fanfare but heavy connotations: “impeachment proceedings.”\n\nThis isn’t really a message most people expect to pop up on their Instagram feeds on a random weekday, and certainly not from USG, an organization that is not seen traditionally (i.e. by me) as a place really worth paying attention to.\n\nWell, it seems like the impossible occurred: something has happened at USG. And I assure you, this isn’t just a regular old something. I went to the emergency meeting, I read the resolution, I looked at the exhibits, and what I saw was a truly sublime level of (alleged) chicanery on the part of a self described “USG bureaucrat.” If President Trump had an ounce of the talent this person has in centralizing and accumulating power, we would all be calling him Il Duce at this point.\n\nThe controversy centers around a student named Nevin Hall, a third year Churchill enthusiast who had somehow managed to become Chair of three separate committees as well as Vice President of Student Organizations (VPSO). Committee Chairs are unelected appointed positions. It is within one of these committees, the Committee on Elections and Rules (E&R), that Hall managed to almost make himself into something of a virtual dictator.\n\nHe accomplished this, as the impeachment resolution alleges, by presenting big lists of bylaw changes to the College Council (CC) while neglecting to mention ones that just so happened to put more and more power into the hands of E&R. Some magnificent examples include giving E&R the power to strike down legislation passed by CC, giving E&R the ability to unilaterally remove members from CC if they had been absent from two or more meetings (mind you, no one ever actually goes to those meetings) and, in the bylaw that got Hall caught red-handed, making the Chair of E&R and its members essentially unimpeachable.\n\nIt's not like these bylaws were in tiny print on the corner of the screen—they were there for anyone to see. Despite this, Hall, who is by all accounts a frighteningly competent workhorse, seemed to have cultivated enough trust within CC for them to give him the benefit of the doubt and pass his changes without giving them a very close look. The bylaws were also covered up in a legalese that even me, a professional law and letters major, found hard to understand. When bylaw changes were proposed on April 28th, however, Kevin Guo, a second year member of CC who somehow understands all that legalese, actually bothered to read the full changes and realized what was happening.\n\nAmong the changes Guo noticed were the provisions that would have given E&R the power to remove CC members and made the E&R Chair unimpeachable, and so he sent out a memo alerting CC of the alterations. Amongst this memo and other swirling accusations that Hall had been biased in his allocation of funds as VPSO, CC voted to request Hall’s resignation as Chair of E&R. He was only being asked to resign from that one position, and it’s not even clear if CC would have been able to do much if he had just hunkered down and refused to go.\n\nInstead, Hall decided to retaliate by attempting to nullify the recent USG election. His apparent reasoning for this, according to someone familiar with the situation, was that since he was being accused of not having acted impartially as VPSO, then clearly he wasn’t an impartial actor, and since the elections were not conducted by an impartial actor as required by the bylaws, they’re null and void—a justification so ridiculous it's almost beautiful. With E&R stacked with Hall's friends, they intended to nullify the election.\n\nOn top of trying to nullify the USG election, Hall also began removing the ability for both CC and randos who go on the USG website, to access various documents. When one CC member complained to Hall, he recommended they appeal the decision to the VPSO, who is Nevin Hall.  It was then that Guo began spearheading a full-on impeachment drive to remove Hall from every position he then occupied as well as the three members of E&R who had formally introduced a motion to nullify the USG election.\n\nIt should be noted at this point that Guo has his own axe to grind with Hall. Last year Guo had sponsored a referendum that Hall allegedly opposed key parts of. After the referendum passed, E&R declared the vote null and void. Their reasoning was as follows: under the Elections Code, E&R was responsible for sending an email notifying the student body three weeks before the vote. However, the email was instead sent two weeks, six days and 15 hours beforehand, resulting in E&R voting to nullify the entire referendum. So, for Guo, there very much was an element of personal antipathy involved in his crusade against Hall, but the nullifying of elections and the revoking of document access certainly seems like enough of an abuse of power to warrant such actions.\n\nCC exercised its emergency powers to call a meeting on the night of May 7th. However, on the morning of May 7th, an E&R meeting had also been apparently scheduled at the last second, according to someone familiar with the situation. What happened at that meeting is shrouded in mystery because all election documents were made private by Hall, but USG President Elijah Jenkins later told CC that E&R had attempted to nullify the Spring 2025 election. At the emergency meeting held that night, as a large group of excited observers passed Costco ice cream amongst themselves, USG’s president and executive vice president nullified the nullification and the impeachment resolution was introduced.\n\nSome of Hall’s accused wrongdoings were more egregious than others. For example, one impeachment article came down to Hall bragging about how much power he had and being mean to Mock Trial. Still, the whole election and documents business seemed to have pissed off enough CC members for the impeachment to pass with 13 votes in favor and 2 abstentions.\n\nThis whole ordeal has brought more attention to USG than it has enjoyed in a long time. Wednesday’s meeting was apparently the best attended USG meeting any of its members had ever seen, something I guarantee was driven almost exclusively by the drama of an impeachment trial. There certainly is a lot of wackiness to go around, but it shouldn’t be forgotten that the reason Hall was able to exercise so much influence over USG in the first place was because he was the only one doing much of the work. I know USG is difficult to care about, but it's clear that if you want a USG that actually claims to represent the student body then you can’t have one guy running the whole place, and that requires more people to pay attention and be involved.\n\nI wonder if this kind of message could be related to anything playing out on the national level…\n\n",

    content: "As someone who spends more time thinking about American presidents than most rational people with normal attention spans do, one of the stranger things about Trump 2.0 has been his obsession with a president you might have heard about like once in APUSH, but otherwise has very little presence in our national imagination: 25th President William McKinley.\n\nHe talked about him constantly on the campaign trail, fawned over him on Joe Rogan, and even resolved to name a mountain after him in his inaugural address. Trump must really like the guy if he’s going around naming mountains after him, but why is he so focused on William McKinley of all people?\n\nA simple answer is tariffs. In his Rogan interview, Donald Trump called McKinley a “tariff king” who “spoke beautifully of tariffs,” and in his inaugural address, said that McKinley made our country “very rich” through tariffs and protection. If we ignore the fact that Trump’s knowledge on McKinley sounds about as deep as a third-grader’s, this notion of an extremely high tariff policy creating economic prosperity is for Trump what makes McKinley a great president—if McKinley made the country great through tariffs, then surely Trump’s tariffs will do the same.\n\nThe real story, however, is more than a little different. Trump may not know this, but McKinley is probably not the best person to bring up when exalting the wonderful power of a tax on foreign imports. Still, Trump bringing McKinley back into the historical limelight provides an interesting opportunity to really look into the man and his effect on the party he led. It is actually quite fitting that Trump has latched on to McKinley so heavily, because similar to how Trump has warped and corroded the Republicans of today, McKinley represents a pivotal turning point in the history of the Republican party for the worse.\n\nThe presidency of William McKinley is the story of a Republican Party with all of its worst impulses amplified and its reformist spirit moribund. There would be great Republican presidents after McKinley, but the changes begun during his presidency taint their administrations and set the Republican party firmly on the long path towards the sorry state it finds itself in today.\n\nHis transgressions are too numerous to fit into one measly article, however, so in order to avoid making this thesis-length and therefore unreadable (I don’t have the time and neither do you), this will just be covering one issue out of four relatively broad topics. Because it’s the only thing Trump actually knows about McKinley and it's demonstrably untrue, we will be starting with those supposedly prosperity-inducing tariffs.\n\nIt’s a little hard to imagine today because of how strong the bipartisan consensus was on trade post WWII, but from the country’s founding until essentially the mid 1930s, tariffs were one of the most enduring and bitterly fought over issues in American politics. Republicans were for high tariffs and Democrats were for low tariffs, a divide that was remarkably stable. By the late Gilded Age it was practically the only issue that set the two parties apart outside of civil rights.\n\nBecause the Republicans were primarily dominant in the era following the Civil War, tariffs tended to be relatively high. This was a commonly understood outcome of Republican governance, and whether or not those tariffs helped spur America’s massive economic and industrial growth throughout the 1870s and 80s is beyond my expertise and besides the point. What is my point is that McKinley took these already high tariffs and pushed them to truly ridiculous levels, with disastrous effects in one case and negligible effects in another.\n\nIt is always slightly curious whenever Trump talks about how great of a president McKinley was because of tariffs, as the tariff McKinley is most known for was passed while he was a Congressman, several years before he became President. It’s almost like Trump doesn’t know what he’s talking about, which would certainly come as an unprecedented shock to the American people.\n\nThe McKinley tariff is the tariff most associated with the former president—it bears his name after all, and is the one people are usually talking about when discussing McKinley’s legacy on the topic. Passed over great controversy in the autumn of 1890, the McKinley tariff raised average duties to a mind boggling 49.5%. Consumers immediately felt the crunch of high prices and reacted by delivering the Republicans a stunning defeat in the subsequent midterm elections. The tariff was so unpopular that McKinley himself was among those who lost reelection.\n\nThe issues with the McKinley Tariff go far beyond simply raising costs, however. By the early 1890s the US government was experiencing a large budget surplus that both parties were looking for ways to get rid of. Republicans, in their infinite wisdom, pitched the McKinley Tariff as a 5D chess way of reducing the surplus by lowering imports, which would then in theory lower total tariff revenue (a reverse Laffer Curve if you will). Instead of just lowering the tariff like normal people, they accomplished a sharp reduction in the surplus at the cost of badly weakening the US economy just as other factors like collapsing wheat prices, a bursting railroad bubble and a run on US gold reserves were combining to create truly dire economic conditions.\n\nThe result was the Panic of 1893, a quaint name for what was the worst economic calamity the country had or ever would experience until the Great Depression.\n\nSo, the McKinley Tariff by itself isn’t really the example you want to be attaching yourself to, but it wasn’t the only piece of tariff legislation McKinley is responsible for. Maybe Trump is much more of a history buff than I originally thought and is actually referring to the far less familiar Dingley Tariff of 1897, passed when McKinley was actually president.\n\nBecause the Republicans lost the 1892 presidential election, they were able to escape blame for the Panic of 1893 and thus were spared from having to learn any actual lessons from the ordeal. Instead, they were able to pretend that the economic crisis caused in part by exorbitant tariffs was in fact the result of tariffs not being high enough. When Republicans returned to power under McKinley in 1897, they were as dedicated to higher tariffs as they had ever been.\n\nDespite all of the tariff drama that had so occupied the country before McKinley’s victory, they actually only made up a small part of his agenda as President. The Republicans passed the Dingley Tariff in 1897, which reversed the tariff reductions that occurred during the preceding Democratic administration and that was it.\n\nAt first glance, this tariff seems to prove Trump and McKinley’s insistence that higher rates bring economic prosperity since the economy recovered during McKinley’s presidency while this tariff was in place. Checkmate liberals! It's an airtight argument, but only if you ignore the basic idea that correlation does not equal causation.\n\nRecovery from the Panic of 1893 had multiple factors, but by far the most important one was the discovery of gold in the Yukon in 1896, which, along with other gold rushes in Australia and Africa around the same time, served to increase the general supply of currency and solve the deflationary crisis that had been driving the depression. The Dingley Tariff had little to no impact, but because of the correlation Republicans could plausibly claim that tariffs had brought the economy back from the panic.\n\nThe McKinley Tariff should have been a learning moment for the Republicans, but a trick of timing allowed them to keep their position and even strengthen their commitment to high tariffs when McKinley became president. The economic recovery under this tariff regime seemed to confirm this idea, even when it wasn’t actually the case.\n\nThe result of this was a Republican Party only strengthened in its conviction that tariffs could solve any economic issue. As any high school junior can tell you, this did not end well.",
